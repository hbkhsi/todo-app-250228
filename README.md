## Deployment Guide

### Building for Production

1. Create an optimized production build:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
2. The production-ready files will be in the `dist` directory

### Deployment Options

#### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel
   ```
3. For production deployment:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

Alternatively, connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments.

#### Netlify

1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```
2. Deploy to Netlify:
   ```
   netlify deploy
   ```
3. For production deployment:
   ```
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

Alternatively, connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployments.

#### GitHub Pages

1. Set the `base` property in `vite.config.js`:
   ```js
   base: '/todo-app-250228/'
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
3. Deploy using GitHub Actions (already configured)

#### Firebase Hosting

   ```

### Environment Variables

The app uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these in your deployment platform or in a `.env` file for local development.

Check the `.env.example` file for available configuration options.

## CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that builds the application on each push to the main branch.

## Performance Optimizations

The production build includes:

- Code splitting for better load time
- CSS purging to remove unused styles
- JavaScript minification
- Tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- Image optimization

## Potential Enhancements

- Task drag-and-drop reordering
- Dark mode support
- Due dates and priority levels
- Categories or tags for tasks
- User accounts and cloud sync
